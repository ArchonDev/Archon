# Archon

**Purpose:** Archon is a multi-use framework designed to emulate, exploit, and fuzz various Protocols, ranging from Typical TCP/IP Packets, to Bluetooth, and even raw Signals via Pyserial. Additionally, it offers a complete cycle of automated Analysis and Exploitation for various Communication types (Packets, RF, BLE Signals, etc).

## Features

- Emulates various Network Protocols
- Exploits Network Protocols to identify vulnerabilities
- Fuzzes various protocols to discover unknown bugs
- Completes automated Analysis and Exploitation of various Communication types

## Installation

Since Archon is written in Python 3, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
I am only intending for the above code to be supported on Linux, such as Kali or Parrot, due to the low level Networking this does.

### Dependencies

There are numerous dependencies required for Archon, which will be listed in a script that is currently being completed.

## Usage

To use Archon, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ArchonDev/Archon.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Archon
    ```

3. (Steps to run the program and examples of how to use it will be added here once the script is complete.)
